    <h2>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h2>
    <p>Progressive enhancement is a philosophy for web design that emphasizes ‘content first’ as the foundation for all web pages.
    This methodology then focuses on layering modern features over the content to utilize user specific browser capabilities.
    The strategy is somewhat in contrast to the antecedent approach of graceful degradation, where websites and applications were made
    to work for the latest and greatest browsers and then towards the end of development there would be follow-up for making sure that
    users with older browsers could still receive content that was essential. </p>
    <p>In essence, progressive enhancement allows for a standard user-experience in a world viewed through different windows so-to-speak.
    Those whose browsers will allow for newer features will get them and those that don’t do not suffer; They still receive the content styled
    for their browser’s capabilities. I found more information on progressive enhancement <a href=https://medium.com/the-mighty-programmer/what-is-progressive-enhancement-and-why-it-matters-e80c7aaf834a>here.</a>
    Praveen Dubey does a great job of explaining the how the approach can provide stability and make maintaining a site or project easier.</p>
    <h2>Dragon Project Revision and Reflection</h2>
    <p>After showing my SpaceX website to my partner and asking her thoughts, I was a bit discouraged when they were all summed up in one word: “nice”. 
    Before this class I had never considered that designing a website involved some experience in…well, design. Things like color schemes, fonts, and margins 
    are not things I have ever had to sit and think about. So, when I pressed my partner for more feedback, her critique was that it was a bit stale. I could see what 
    she meant, nothing really moved, and my color palate was anything but bold.</p>
    <p>In my revision I decide to add the picture slideshow that we learned from the cycle demo do add some movement to the page that did not require interaction. 
    Design not being a developed skill yet, I figured a moving feature may hide my inexperience. In doing this, a previous assignment proved to be more useful than 
    I would have originally thought. I was able to use the flexbox froggy lesson to adjust the images to the center of the gallery container as they were kind of 
    all over the place when I first tried it out.</p>
    <p>I have learned that designing a webpage is a bit like two jobs in one, where you are not only a web developer but also an interior designer or an architect. 
    Developing a website is almost like putting together and office workspace. Will the background color be calming or to jarring? How much emphasis should we put on 
    this information and will the user find it easily? Will the client easily find their way to these services listed over here?</p>
    <p>I have taken a couple of programming courses so dealing with syntax and directories was something I was familiar with. However, if I had to start this semester over, 
    I would have started heavier with the reading than I originally did. Catching up on reading always sound easy but kind of slows you down. Other than that, it was really 
    the events of the year that got in the way. As someone who could not attend the classes live and instead had to watch the recording afterwards, I still think this was a 
    fun and interactive course. Plenty of resources were available which helped me since I was not able to ask questions in class. Also, learning HTML, then CSS, and then dipping your 
    toe into JavaScript was nice path to learning the material and it all tying in with progressive enhancement made it click a bit more.</p>
